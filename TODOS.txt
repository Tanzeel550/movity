1)  Implement 2 step verification process for both login and signup actions
    For this purpose, I will have to write backend for firebase to setup firebase_admin and then use
    firebase_admin.auth().getUserByEmail(email) and then send verification email to the user

2)  Eliminate bootstrap from our project. And write our own css. Using Either flexbox or grid!
    The classes which need more styling are input, container
    The most bootstrap polluted component in our entire app is FormComponent.

3)  Implement other functionalities like sortBy (date, alphabetical-order etc),
    search functionality (through a list of added movies), folder functionality (like movies in a folder according to date, genre etc)
    dark mode

4)  Forgot password functionality, facebook login, github login etc.

5)  Transform the whole project to NextJS
